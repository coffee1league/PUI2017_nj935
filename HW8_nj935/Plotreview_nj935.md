 This plot visualized restaurant 
sanitation violations grouped by seasons (Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall )  and grouped by types of cuisine served (American, Chinese, Pizza, etc), 

The type of plot utilized was a pie chart. The innovative part of the plot is that it saught to 
catergorize poor sanitation scores by season as well types of food as this might lead to conclusions around seasons. The author indeed concludes that based on the four seasons visualized, summer tends to have  greatest number of sanitation violations for American cuisine esablishments. 

However, the difficulty with reading pie charts in general is in comparing the seasons to one another visually given the different color schemes and the differences in slices to each other. Perhaps an alternative way to compare sanitation violation scores across different seasons is through a line graph ( each line could represent a type of food ), or through a histogram. The pie chart is clearly labeled however since the color coding changes in each pie chart to represent the highest to least porportion of the total, it may confuse a hurried reader as they may think that the color might correspond to types of cuisine. 

The author additionally posted a histogram of raw score counts which made it easier to compare scores across the seasons.  Perhaps a fractional score or a percentage would have been a good way to standardize the comparison across time. One recommendation for the second plot is 
to space out the second row of plots in order to have more space to read the labels. Additionally, a Y-axis label might be helpful for the reader. 

Second plot posted by the author for the same data:
