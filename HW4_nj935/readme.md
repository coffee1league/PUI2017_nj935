Nick's homework 4 for PUI 2017

**HW1 and 2**: I did these independently.

**HW3 and 4**: Done during communal homework sessions with Andrew, Valerie, Matt and Guobing. We helped each other on pieces of theory and coding while keeping each homework as an independent work.

### Assignment 2: examples of statistical analysis from PLOS

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|

ANOVA	| Speed abilities (SA) and technical skills (TA) in early adolescence | Continuous | Adult Performance Level (APL): a variable defined in the study to measure success as a soccer player | Ordinal (1= pro player, 2=semi pro, 3=non pro) | Age (above average age when tests taken affects speed and technical scores unfairly) | 	Continuous | Do speed and technical skills in early adolescence predict success as a professional soccer player | H0: Adult APL for adolescents with high SA and TA <= APL for adolescents with low SA and TA.  | 0.05 | [The influence of speed abilities and technical skills in early adolescence on adult success in soccer: A long-term prospective analysis](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182211#pone-0182211-g002)
Multivariate logistic regression	| Occurrence of tropical cyclones in specific geographic area | Ordinal (5 types of storm event ordered by severity) | Infectious diarrhea occurance normalized by population | Continuous | Weather conditions including temperature | Continuous | Do tropical cyclones cause a rise in infectious diarrea in coastal Guangdong | H0: diarrhea prevalence without cyclone <= diarrhea prevalence with cyclone.  | 0.05 | [Impacts of Different Grades of Tropical Cyclones on Infectious Diarrhea in Guangdong, 2005-2011](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131423)
Multiple linear regression	| Distance to clinic, gender, education, incarerated or not, age, others | Mainly continuous, some categorical (eg. gender), some discrete (eg. age) | Retention rate after 18 months for program participants (ie. do they keep taking their methadone treatment) | Continuous | Modality of methadone treatment | Categorical | What factors affect whether heroin addicts undergoing methadone treatment stick to the treatment or drop out | H0: For each factor w1 ... wn, wn=0. This is in the context of a regression equation with wn regression coefficients.  | 0.05 | [Factors Associated with Methadone Treatment Duration: A Cox Regression Analysis](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123687)
