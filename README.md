# PUI2017_nj935
## First step

In my bash_profile, I created two things:
* an environmental variable for 'PUI2017', pointing to my pui2017 folder.
* an alias 'pui2017', to cd into the directory represented by the environmental variable.

## Second step

Then I used the alias to move into the directory, and checked I was in the right place.

That's everything - the environmental variable and alias are both working fine.
