_Assignment 1:_
I plotted 100 random samples for each of 5 probability distributions. These were normal, binomial, poisson, chi-square and logistic. I plotted scatter charters of the sample size against sample mean for each of them. I then plotted the distribution of the means as a histogram. This showed that, according to the central limit theorem, if you repeat a non-normal experiment enough time, the resulting distribution of the means will be normally distributed. This is a helpful statistical property that means we can analyze many phenomena - from coin tosses (binomial distribution) to people arriving at subway stations (poisson distribution) - using the normal distribution.

_Assignment 2:_
I loaded citibike data for June 2016. I put it in a dataframe and dropped irrelevent fields. I formulated a hypothesis around men making longer rides than women on average. To begin testing this, I calculated the mean journey time of both genders. The initial indication is that my hypothesis is wrong, and women take longer rides than men.

Note: I had major problems with the Compute environment. I couldn't get it to load up into Compute. Please be lenient when marking this because I don't know if it's my fault or what the problem is, thank you :-)
